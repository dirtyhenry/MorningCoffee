<blockquote>Adult Swim (...) introduced the Adult Swim Singles Program, a sweet little online series that gave away free mp3s and videos of mostly unreleased tracks from a very cool cross-genre list of artists, including Madvillain, Bonnie "Prince" Billy and Matt Sweeney, Cults, Killer Mike, and Washed Out.</blockquote>
Cette semaine, donc, Best Coast au programme.
