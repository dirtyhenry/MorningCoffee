Peter Hook, about the New Order reunion :
<blockquote>Everyone knows that NEW ORDER without PETER HOOK is like QUEEN without FREDDIE MERCURY, U2 without THE EDGE, SOOTY without SWEEP! On a more serious note, I do not understand the decision THE OTHER THREE have taken. I wish they had approached me first. I do not agree with the methods they have used and feel it would have been courteous and professional to have spoken to me in advance of the announcements. It is very sad.</blockquote>
I kind of agree with Hook on this but I have an idea of what he would have said if he had gently been asked his opinion.

NO.
