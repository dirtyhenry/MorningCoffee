<blockquote>Recognizing the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's assertion that three of the riskiest driving behaviors are hard acceleration, hard deceleration and hard swerves, the new Driver Feedback app focuses on helping drivers avoid them. The app’s accelerometer recording technology measures the user's acceleration, braking and cornering and then awards a score for each along with an overall score for each trip. Next, it offers tips to make driving safer the next time.</blockquote>
L'appli n'est cependant pas disponible sur le store français.
