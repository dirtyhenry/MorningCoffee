Dave Morin (CEO de Path) annonce la suppression des <a title="Désinstaller Path ?" href="http://morningcoffee.mickaelflochlay.com/1327/desinstaller-path">données collectées</a> :
<blockquote>We believe you should have control when it comes to sharing your personal information. We also believe that actions speak louder than words. So, as a clear signal of our commitment to your privacy, we’ve deleted the entire collection of user uploaded contact information from our servers. Your trust matters to us and we want you to feel completely in control of your information on Path.

In Path 2.0.6, released to the App Store today, you are prompted to opt in or out of sharing your phone’s contacts with our servers in order to find your friends and family on Path. If you accept and later decide you would like to revoke this access, please send an email to service@path.com and we will promptly see to it that your contact information is removed.</blockquote>
