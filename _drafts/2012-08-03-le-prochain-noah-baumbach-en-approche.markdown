<blockquote>The line-up for the Toronto International Film Festival was announced today, and with it the announcement of a new film from frequent Wes collaborator Noah Baumbach. The film is called Frances Ha and stars Greta Gerwig, who also co-wrote, as “a dancer who moves to New York City and becomes caught up in a whirlwind of flighty fair-weather friends, diminishing fortunes and career setbacks.”</blockquote>
