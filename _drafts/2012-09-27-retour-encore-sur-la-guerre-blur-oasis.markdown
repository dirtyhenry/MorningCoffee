Liam Gallagher :
<blockquote>At the time I hated Blur, I thought they were just pansies from London and we were a totally different thing. You [the NME and the press in general] might have done certain things, but no-one told me whether I liked someone or not. I thought it was just all good fun.</blockquote>
