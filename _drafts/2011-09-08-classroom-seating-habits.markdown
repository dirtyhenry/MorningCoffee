<blockquote>Skyrill, a two-brother design team, took it upon themselves to visualize the seating habits of their graduate student classmates in class 15.514 at MIT.</blockquote>
Worth to see. Tools used to create the visualization are :
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">d3</a> : a small, free JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data.</li>
	<li>jQuery</li>
	<li>i think the d3 library creates a SVG ouput</li>
</ol>
d3 is the part I had never heard of. It sounds exciting.
