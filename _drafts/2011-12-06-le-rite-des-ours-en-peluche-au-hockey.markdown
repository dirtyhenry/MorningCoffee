<blockquote>In case youâ€™re unaware of this annual rite, fans bring stuffed animals to the game and throw them on the ice when the home team scores its first goal. (Delay of game penalties have no home here.) The toys are collected and donated to local charity.

Seriously, seeing the teddy bears fly when the goal is scored is one of the best unique sights in hockey.</blockquote>
