<blockquote>The new site will continue to evolve, so youll see more advances in design and editorial soon, including a mobile version of the site and new features that will offer deeper coverage of a broader range of music. Theres a lot of exciting stuff ahead. But for now, take a look around. And as always, thanks for reading.</blockquote>
