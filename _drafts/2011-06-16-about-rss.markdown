Hier, sur <a href="http://www.mickaelflochlay.com/spip/Applications-iPad-mon-top-5">ce post de mon blog</a>, je disais que le RSS était un incompris. On retrouve un peu la même chose ici :
<blockquote>Dead?

Yes and no. It’s plumbing, and, behind-the-scenes, RSS is doing a lot more work than most people realize, outside of RSS readers.

We understand the limit of the appeal of a traditional RSS reader. The idea that those apps as-they-are-now could become mass market hits is finished.

They can still be modest hits, though, and ambitious and smart developers will go well beyond the traditional RSS reader and make reader apps that will become mass-market hits.

And those reader apps will still make great use of RSS, but the RSS-iness will become invisible plumbing.

Summary: it’s complicated, but “not-dead” is the correct answer.</blockquote>
