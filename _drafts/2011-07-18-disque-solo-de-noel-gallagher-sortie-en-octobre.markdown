<blockquote>[Noel Gallagher] announced [July 6] that he will be releasing two solo albums, the first of which is titled 'Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds' and will be released on October 17.

He also confirmed he would be touring around the time of the album's release and playing Oasis songs as part of the live set.</blockquote>
Je suis un peu à la bourre sur la question, mais l'information reste d'importance !
