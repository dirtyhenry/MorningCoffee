Maybe we could go back to the Marquee to accept a plaque for 50 years of service instead of a tour. That could work - except Keith obviously can't come. Charlie Watts [who wasn't in the band in 1962] can come but he wouldn't get the plaque obviously.

Mick Jagger, 11, still upset about what <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2010/10/16/keith-richards-mocks-size-of-mick-jagger-s-penis-115875-22638008/">Keith said about his weenie</a>.
