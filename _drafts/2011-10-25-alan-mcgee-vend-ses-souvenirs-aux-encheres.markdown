Alan McGee, au sujet de la vente aux enchères de ses souvenirs de sa période Oasis :
<blockquote>As I have said many times before – I can't be arsed with music anymore. I moved to Wales to get away from it, why would I want it in my basement? As for my financial situation – on last count I have five big houses so I think I'll be ok in my old age.</blockquote>
