<blockquote>Recorded during the In The Aeroplane Over The Sea sessions, this previously unreleased take of “Engine” (originally released as a b-side to the “Holland, 1945″ single) features the notoriously reticent Jeff Mangum at a most vulnerable state, his vocals sounding as clear as ever floating aimlessly over the simple strumming of his guitar and the sorrowful warble of a saw.</blockquote>
Great song.
