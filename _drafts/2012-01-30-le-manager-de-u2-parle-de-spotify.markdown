Paul McGuinness :
<blockquote>Spotify has yet to become popular with artists because artists don't see the financial benefit. That's partly the fault of the labels because labels partly-own Spotify, and there is insufficient transparency. (...)Â Why are [Google people] not trying to solve the future in a more generous way? Ultimately it's in their interests that the flow of content will continue. And that won't happen unless it's paid for.</blockquote>
