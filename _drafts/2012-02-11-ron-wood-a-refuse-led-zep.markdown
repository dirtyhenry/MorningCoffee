Ron Wood :
<blockquote>Peter Grant used to manage myself and Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart and Mickey Waller and Nicky Hopkins back in the good old days. (...) He was behind a band that was going to be called The New Yardbirds.Â I had an offer to join, and I said 'I can't join that bunch of farmers'. Anyway, they eventually changed their name and turned out to be Led Zeppelin, and he managed them as well.</blockquote>
