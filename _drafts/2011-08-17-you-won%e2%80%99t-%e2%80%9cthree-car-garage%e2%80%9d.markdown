IGIF recommends this Boston band. Which is cool.
<blockquote>I was just sent this track from Boston’s You Won’t, a bedroom folk pop project that’s catchy enough to draw in ears but eccentric enough to keep them guessing. (...) Through and through, they do well of creating their own minimalist bedroom pop that’s as catchy as it is refreshing.</blockquote>
Found their Bandcamp page as well : http://youwont.bandcamp.com/
