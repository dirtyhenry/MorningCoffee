<blockquote>You can listen to the same song, at the exact same timeâ€”so when your favorite vocal part comes in you can experience it together, just like when you're jamming out at a performance or dance club .

However, the service will only work if both parties have access to the same online music programmes. At the moment, only Spotify and Rdio can be used in conjunction with 'Listen With Friends', although ZDNet claims that more services are set to be announced in the future.</blockquote>
