<blockquote>Back in the late 90s, when her band Bikini Kill was close to breaking up, feminist punk icon Kathleen Hanna launched a messy, lo-fi, sample-heavy solo project called Julie Ruin and released a self-titled album in 1998 on Kill Rock Stars. It presaged the synthier music she'd soon make with Le Tigre. Now, Hanna has relaunched a new version of that project, a five-piece band called the Julie Ruin.</blockquote>
