<blockquote>But now Damon Albarn is saying that they’ve recorded another track; they just have no plans to release it. (...) The group made the song in response to the news that the Notting Hill Carnival, London’s annual gigantic multi-culti throwdown, might be canceled. But when the Carnival went on as planned, the band decided not to release the song after all. (...) “It was a perfect plea to reinstate the carnival. So it wasn’t relevant; it was relevant for about 12 hours.”
