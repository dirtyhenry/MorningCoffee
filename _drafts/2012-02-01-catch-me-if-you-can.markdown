<blockquote>Dion is a gate crasher. He’s snuck his way into more than 30 Super Bowls without a ticket. Impressive but that doesn’t really give Dion proper dues, it’s not just the Super Bowl. He’s also successfully burgled into boxing title fights, triple crown races, World Series games and even the Academy Awards. His Jack Bauer like skills knows no bounds.</blockquote>
Encore une super histoire. Merci Chitwood &amp; Hobbs !
