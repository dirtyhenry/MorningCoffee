<blockquote>Time and time again, creative people are given two pieces of advice: (1) Listen to your critics and seek feedback, but also (2) Ignore your critics and follow your intuition. Clearly, there's a powerful contradiction here in need of reconciliation.Â (...)

Knowing which feedback to embrace and which to discard is perhaps the most important instinct for a creative leader to possess. (...)

Criticism is doubt informed by curiosity and a deep knowledge of a discipline related to your work. (...)

By contrast, cynicism is a form of doubt resulting from ignorance and antiquated ways.</blockquote>
