<blockquote>Hollywood actress and director Julie Delpy is set to direct a new film about the life of The Clash frontman Joe Strummer.

According to Variety, the film, entitled The Right Profile, will apparently focus on the guitarist and singer’s Clash years as well as his planned disappearance from the public spotlight in 1982. The film is named after a song on the punk classic ‘London Calling’ and will be produced by Simon Halfon.</blockquote>
