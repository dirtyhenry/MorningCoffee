<blockquote>Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder publishes his autobiography, Twisting My Melon, today (September 15).

The book will look at Salford-born Ryder’s life in depth, including his addiction to heroin, which started when he was 18 and his forming of the Happy Mondays in 1980. It will also cover the band’s rise to fame which culminated in their third album, ‘Pills, Thrills And Bellyaches’, which was produced by Paul Oakenfold and entered the charts at Number One.</blockquote>
Ça doit pas être triste comme bouquin.
