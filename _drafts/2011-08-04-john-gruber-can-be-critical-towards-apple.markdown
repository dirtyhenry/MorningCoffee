John Gruber, about the Amazon Kindle Team explaining why they removed the link to their store inside their iOS app :
<blockquote>This is the result of Apple putting its own interests ahead of those of its users. Itâ€™s certainly not drastic (as it would be if Amazon had pulled the app from the store entirely), but in no way can it be argued that this is an improvement for users.</blockquote>
Some people often complain Gruber is not critical enough towards Apple but when Apple makes bad decision, he says so.
