Dean Lorey:
<blockquote>We’re really doing this thing. Mitch Hurwitz, Jim Vallely and I are off writing the new season of Arrested Development to premiere on Netflix in 2013. The original cast is back. There are offices and parking spaces. We’re shooting this year. I wish I could give more specifics but, for the moment, even the schedule is being kept under wraps. But it's happening and it’s great to be back with my pals from the show. More later as it becomes okay to release further details.</blockquote>
