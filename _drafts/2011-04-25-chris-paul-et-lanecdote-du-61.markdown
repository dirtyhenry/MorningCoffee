<blockquote>This young man was very close to a grandfather that had just passed away and to honer his grandfather he wanted to score a point for every year of his grandfatherâ€™s life 61. On the sixty-first point he was fouled. He went to the line, threw up an air ball and walked off the court. This young man, of course, was Chris Paul.</blockquote>
