Springwise about the <a href="http://www.nauticalmonkey.com/">Nautical Monkey</a> service :
<blockquote>More practically however, the network also enables owners to find potential sharing partners they trust. Once a partner has been found, the platform’s “Resource Library” provides numerous example legal documents, which can be browsed to find a contract which best suits the type of sharing agreement the partners would like to enter into.

Once an agreement has been reached, the platform also aims to make the ongoing sharing of a boat as simple as possible. The built-in online calendar lets users schedule, change and cancel boating trips, and the maintenance log lets users file service and repair requests. The platform also hosts an “Expense Tracking” service which enables users to track and share the cost of items purchased for the vessel. A Nautical Monkey mobile website means that all of this functionality is also available for access via mobile phone.</blockquote>
This sounds very similar to what I've tried to set in Paris about music stuff: amps, mics and speakers. One of the reasons why it didn't work was maybe the person-to-person (which was good but limited to the 2 or 3 bands I'm friend enough with) approach rather than the web approach (with which audience can be much wider). Maybe I'll try again later if nobody does it...
