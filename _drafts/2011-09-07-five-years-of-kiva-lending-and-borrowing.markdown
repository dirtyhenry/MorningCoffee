<blockquote>Kiva, the microfinance site, lets you give small loans to people around the world to help them get their small business up and running. This animated map shows how 620,000 funded 615,000 borrowers, from the start of Kiva in 2005 up until now.</blockquote>
Great video for a great service that deserves better exposure in France.
