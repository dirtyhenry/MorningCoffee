Chitwood &amp; Hobbs about an unlikely picture :
<blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger, Hugh Hefner and Wilt Chamberlain hanging out at the Playboy Mansion in 1977. If there wasn’t photographic evidence I’m not sure I would believe this meeting of the minds actually happened. Can I get a transcript of what this conversation was about? Too bad what happens at the Playboy Mansion, stays at the Playboy Mansion.</blockquote>
