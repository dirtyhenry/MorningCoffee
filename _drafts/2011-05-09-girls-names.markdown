<blockquote>"Lawrence", the first track on this record by Girls Names, starts with a woozy, tape-warped guitar strum and a spate of whirring white noise. (...) But after a few seconds, the noise dissipates to make way for a slippery riff that leads into an effortlessly catchy, sun-kissed pop tune.</blockquote>
Catchy, sun-kissed pop tune ? C'est mon style !
