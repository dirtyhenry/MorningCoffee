<blockquote>McCartney is probably, from a historic perspective, the single most important living musician on the planet, even if he owes that importance almost entirely to stuff he did between the ages of 22 and 17. (...) McCartney managed to reach this particular milestone with mental and physical health completely intact, which is more than Brian Wilson, his closest living peer, can really say. He’s richer than God. He’s still got his dignity. He’s still working, and he’s still got the accumulated goodwill of a few generations of listeners. All of these things are reasons for celebration.</blockquote>
