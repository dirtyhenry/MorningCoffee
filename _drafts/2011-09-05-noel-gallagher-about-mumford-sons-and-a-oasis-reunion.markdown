About Mumford &amp; Sons :
<blockquote>I haven't heard anything that sounds as good as that. (...) I wish had written that song. That's the biggest compliment I can pay whoever wrote that.</blockquote>
And about a possible Oasis reunion :
<blockquote>I don't need the fucking money, but I think it's a shame that songs like ‘Champagne Supernova’, ‘Rock 'N' Roll Star’, ‘The Importance of Being Idle’ and ‘The Shock of the Lightning’ will never be played again. In a stadium. That kind of fills me with sadness.</blockquote>
