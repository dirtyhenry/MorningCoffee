<blockquote>Bobby V. has quite a few memorable coaching moments but none of them can top his infamous Interleague Play episode. On June 9, 1999 the Mets were involved in a marathon game against the Blue Jays. During the 12th inning Bobby Valentine was ejected for arguing a catcherâ€™s interference call against Mike Piazza. Valentine left the game only to return from the clubhouse an inning later in a disguise. The fake mustache and sunglasses bought him time in the dugout but also cost him a $5,000 fine and a two game suspension.</blockquote>
Another great fun story from Chitwood &amp; Hobbs!
