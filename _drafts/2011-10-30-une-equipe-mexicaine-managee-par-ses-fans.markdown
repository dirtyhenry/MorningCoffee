<blockquote>Participating in the Mexican second division, the Murcielagos FC has no staff trainer or coach leading the team’s efforts, according to a report on A Bite Of. Rather, whenever there’s a key decision to be made, choices are posted for supporters to vote on. The fans can vote online or via text message on everything from game tactics and team configuration, to player selection and in-game substitutions. They can even vote to decide which players will be awarded bonuses.</blockquote>
