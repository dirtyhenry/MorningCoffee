1/ Il prévoit un événement centré sur l'éducation pour octobre :
<blockquote>My best guess for October: an education theme. A smaller (and less expensive) iPad seems like an obvious fit for schools and as a holiday gift for kids. We know from last January’s iBooks event in New York that Apple considers education a high priority, and the iPad is at the center of it. Plus, it would nicely fit with new Macintosh hardware — say, a 13-inch MacBook Pro with Retina Display and a refreshed lineup of iMacs (but not yet retina, I’m almost certain — affordable 27-inch retina displays remain beyond even Apple’s ken today). Roll in some news from textbook publishers, education-focused app developers, and of course, some iPad games, and Apple would have a solid event.</blockquote>

2/ Son commentaire sur le choix du port de recharge de l'iPhone 5 :

<blockquote>
Apple chose wrongly? Apple’s choices came down to:
<ul>
	<li>
<blockquote>Stick with the existing 30-pin port, despite it being old, ugly, and so thick that it had become the limiting factor for how thin and small devices could be.</blockquote>
</li>
	<li>
<blockquote>Switch to an industry standard that, though small, was not as elegant or well-designed as what Apple could do on its own, and would cost Apple its control over the peripheral market. (And we’d still need dongles for existing 30-pin peripherals.)
</li>
	<li>
<blockquote>Invent something new and proprietary that looks and works exactly how Apple wants it to.</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
If you think Apple spent much time pondering anything but the third option, you don’t understand Apple.
