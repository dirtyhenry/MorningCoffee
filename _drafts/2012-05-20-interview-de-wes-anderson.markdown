<blockquote>I had spent about a year trying to write this script, and at the end of it I had about fourteen pages and I was really stuck. I had a lot of notes and ideas, but I didn’t have any story. And I asked Roman [Coppola] to come help me, and he read everything I had, and he very quickly suggested that I was missing a sort of flashback for these two children [falling in love], and that opened up the next big section of the movie for me. And we spent another month working on it, and at the end of the month, the script was done. So, for me, it was a help I desperately needed, and he knew exactly how to provide it.</blockquote>
