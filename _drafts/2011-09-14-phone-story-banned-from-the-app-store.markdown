<blockquote>Phone Story is an educational game about the dark side of your favorite smart phone. Follow your phone's journey around the world and fight the market forces in a spiral of planned obsolescence.</blockquote>
Phone Story was a game aiming to inform people about 4 problems they think Apple and iPhone purchasers are part of : Coltan's mines in Congo, work rights in electronic devices assembling factories, Â the short lifespan of devices and the electronic waste management. Their site is interesting in the sense they're not only criticizing but also points out what they think should be done.
