Interpol :
<blockquote>We spent a good deal of time this past year digging through our archives and asking others to dig through theirs in the hopes of uncovering some forgotten material.Â The result of our hunting and gathering has yielded this Tenth Anniversary Edition of <em>Turn On The Bright Lights</em>. We wanted to do something special for the fans who have always supported us. We wanted to do something special for the best fans in the world. We hope you enjoy it.</blockquote>
