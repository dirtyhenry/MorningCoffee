<blockquote>Why have a case if it doesn’t have a handle? Do you really want to hide half your case under your arm? Silva LTD has designed your case so that it feels comfortable in your hand and shows off as much as it can, while still protecting your MacBook. We also made the case to cover the entire computer, not just a portion, leaving nothing to chance.</blockquote>
Stylé mais pas parfait : cher, non livrable en France et quid des accessoires ? (chargeur, souris, disques durs externes, etc.)
