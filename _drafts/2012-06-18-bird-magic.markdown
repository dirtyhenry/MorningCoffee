<blockquote>“Magic, I’m so sorry,” Bird said.

“No, it’s going to be all right,” Magic said. “I have to take some medication and do some different stuff but I’m going to fight this thing.”

The two superstars talked briefly. If Johnson was reeling from his diagnosis, he adeptly concealed it.

“So,” Magic said, “how are the Celtics looking?”

Bird was momentarily speechless.

“Ah, hell,” he replied. “We’ll probably kick your ass.”

When Bird hung up the phone, he turned to Dinah and reported, “He was trying to cheer me up.”</blockquote>
