Jarvis Cocker, Ã©voquant la mort d'Amy Winehouse :
<blockquote>Amy Winehouse passed away this year and it was all 'drugs killed Amy Winehouse'. I think that the press killed Amy Winehouse as much as drugs did, because it sends people into that place where they've got no peace, and so they just try to escape. And sometimes you use drugs and drink to do that.</blockquote>
