<blockquote>Now in beta, Social Memories aims to give Facebook users a way to preserve their virtual lives in physical form. Users of the app, which is available in both German and English, begin by specifying the timeframe theyâ€™d like their book to cover. A minimum of 10 uploaded photos and 10 status updates since June 2009 are required. Social Memories then scans and analyzes that Facebook activity, reproducing photographs as well as creating a range of infographics revealing highlights and trends. With a customizable color scheme, the resulting book can then be viewed online for free. If users choose to order a professionally bound copy, the price is EUR 19 plus shipping; worldwide delivery is available.</blockquote>
