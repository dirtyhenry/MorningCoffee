<blockquote>The band works by utilising an acid release agent, which decomposes when exposed to sunlight causing the band to change color. There are different bands available to suit different skin types – so a person with fairer skin will find that their band changes color quicker than someone who tans easily.

(...) The band is currently being commercialised, with Swedish-based Intellego Technology preparing to make the product available for the market in spring 2013.</blockquote>
