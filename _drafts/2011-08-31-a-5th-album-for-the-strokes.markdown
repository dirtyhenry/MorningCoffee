<blockquote>Julian Casablancas admitted that he stalled sessions for the new album, which will be the band's fifth.</blockquote>
I'm convinced that Angles (item nÂ°4 in the Strokes' discography) was rushed to release some pressure from the band and that the next one will meet higher standards, partly due to lower expectations.
<blockquote>He hinted at tensions with guitarist Nick Valensi, who apparently wanted to record a solo album of songs put together by The Strokes.</blockquote>
Valensi's idea makes sense though. He's a great composer and the Strokes are a great band.
