Rowan Atkinson :
<blockquote>I've always regarded Mr Bean as an ageless, timeless figure. I don't want him to particularly grow old, and if I carry on playing him then he's going to get older, whether we like it or not. I would like to remember Mr Bean how he was five or 10 years ago.</blockquote>
