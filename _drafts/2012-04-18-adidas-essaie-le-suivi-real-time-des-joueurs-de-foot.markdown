<blockquote>miCoach is a suite of devices and software built into sports apparel that monitors the performance of athletes — such as heart rate, movement and goal achievements — in real time while they are training or in competition. (...) Still in development, adidas will be trialling the equipment at the 2012 AT&amp;T Major League Soccer All-Star Game in Philadelphia on July 25th as well as throughout the rest of the MLS season. Coaches will be able to use the suite to analyze player positions and performance, and can then make strategic changes based on the data. miCoach will be rolled out to the public once it has been successfully tested.</blockquote>
