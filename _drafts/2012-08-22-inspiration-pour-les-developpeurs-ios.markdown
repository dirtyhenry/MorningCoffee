<blockquote>Is There Hope for the Paid App?

Sure there is. Just do what Starbucks does:
<ul>
	<li>Build an app experience that’s unique and doesn’t feel “easily replicated”</li>
	<li>Provide something the user sees as valuable to their daily life</li>
	<li>Package it such that it shows off its craftsmanship</li>
	<li>Find creative ways to profit off of a “free” version (Starbucks doesn’t do this…. yet)</li>
	<li>Quit complaining about money wasted on cups of coffee</li>
</ul>
