Stiller Ã  propos des personnages Derek et Hansel (Owen Wilson) :
<blockquote>Their lives have changed and theyre not really relevant anymore. Its a new world for them. Will Ferrell is written into the script and hes expressed interest in doing it. I think Mugatu is an integral part of the Zoolander story, so yes, he features in a big way.</blockquote>
