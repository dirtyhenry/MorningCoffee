<blockquote>Jarvis Cocker, frontman for the recently-reunited Britpop wonders, is one of the all-time great rock lyricists. His words include layer upon layer of winky reference, sexed-up come-on, self-deprecating humor, and groanworthy pun-- not to mention some truly heartfelt and wonderfully rendered sentiments. As the Quietus reports, Faber &amp; Faber will publish Cocker's first lyrics collection, Mother, Brother, Lover: Selected Lyrics, in October.</blockquote>
Great news!
