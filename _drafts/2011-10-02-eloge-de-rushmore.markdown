Edgar Wright :
<blockquote>The actual film is a brilliant gem by Wes Anderson, and one that still shines brightly today. Just in the past year, we’ve seen a number of films that walk in the shadow of this one. Of course, it wouldn’t have inspired so many movies, music videos, commercials, and TV shows if it wasn’t such a distinctive effort.

This is an undeniable cult classic, one that every Max Fischer on the planet has on their shelf.</blockquote>
