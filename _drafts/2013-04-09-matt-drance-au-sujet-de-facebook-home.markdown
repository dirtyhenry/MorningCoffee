<blockquote>
<p>It gives Facebook the experience, confidence, credibility, momentum, and time to build a better and broader mobile experience than they would have been able to build otherwise. It’s as prudent as it is ambitious.</p>
<p>(…)</p>
<p>The Google – Facebook war is sure to be more vicious than the Google – Apple war because <em>Google and Facebook have the same customers: advertisers.<span> </span></em>Users are their currency, and Facebook is about to rob the bank.</p>
