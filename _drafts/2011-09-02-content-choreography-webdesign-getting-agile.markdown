<blockquote>The production model of passing a site down the assembly line from design to development to launch seems to be an inefficient approach for responsive &amp; adaptive site design. I think the Paravel method of gathering around a table &amp; slugging every decision out until launch lends itself to the level of reiteration necessary for these projects. Weâ€™ve found that the best way forward is to pull all members of a team together to design, build, test and then evaluate in multiple quick rounds.</blockquote>
