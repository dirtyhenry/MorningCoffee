<blockquote>According to Deadline, the pair will then begin shooting Swear To God in July (2013). The film will focus on a megalomaniac hedge fund manager, played by Ferrell, whose life changes when he thinks he sees God.

(...) Justin Theroux has now been hired to direct and rewrite the movie. This will mark Theroux's debut as director, but the actor has previous screenwriting experience, having scripted Iron Man 2 and co-scripted Tropic Thunder and Rock Of Ages.

Theroux, 42, is probably best known for his acting roles in the David Lynch movies Mulholland Drive and Inland Empire. He has been dating Jennifer Aniston, his co-star in 2011's Wanderlust, since May 2011. Both Ferrell and Carell have movies out in the US this month (August). Ferrell stars in political comedy The Campaign, while Carell appears alongside Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee-Jones in rom-com Hope Springs.</blockquote>
