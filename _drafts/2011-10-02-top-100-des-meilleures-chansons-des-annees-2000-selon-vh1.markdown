<blockquote>VH1 has just published a list of its 100 greatest songs of the last decade, and spoiler alert: This thing is insane! It leans heavily toward the radio-pop side of things, and it’s actually a bit refreshing to see someone trying to invent an alternate canon of this stuff instead of reminding us once again that Radiohead are the greatest thing ever. But this alternate canon? This alternate canon is weird!</blockquote>
