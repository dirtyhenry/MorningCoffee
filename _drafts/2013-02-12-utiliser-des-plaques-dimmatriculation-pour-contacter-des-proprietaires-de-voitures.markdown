<blockquote>Passersby who see a vehicle with its lights left on, blocking an exit or being vandalized, usually feel helpless to do anything about it. CurbTXT allows drivers to register their vehicle’s license plate and phone number, which is stored on its database. They also receive a bumper sticker to alert passersby that they are registered. When someone needs to get in touch with the owner of a vehicle, they can send a text — which should begin with the state code and license plate number — to the CurbTXT number and the service will forward it on to the driver.</blockquote>
Super smart. Disponible uniquement à San Francisco pour le moment.
