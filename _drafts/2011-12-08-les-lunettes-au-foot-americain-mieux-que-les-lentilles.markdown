<blockquote>Bob Griese was legally blind in his right eye. I’d say the two-time Super Bowl winning Hall of Fame quarterback overcame the impairment. You might wonder why Griese wore glassesand not contact lenses on the field. I know I wondered, so I looked it up.

During an exhibition game before the 1977 Griese did try contact lenses. At this time Griese was QB 1 and filled in as kicker for the injured Garo Yepremian. During the first half of the game Griese missed an extra-point kick. At halftime he switched from the contacts to regular glasses and connected on two extra points on the second half. End of experiment. Due to either superstition or performance, Griese would wear glasses behind his face mask.</blockquote>
