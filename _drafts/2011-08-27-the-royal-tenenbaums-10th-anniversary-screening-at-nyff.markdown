<blockquote>The 49th Annual New York Film Festival will be taking place next month, and they’ve announced a ten-year anniversary screening of Wes’ masterpiece The Royal Tenenbaums. The screening will take place October 13th, and will be followed by a Q&amp;A with Wes and cast members from the film. The film of course had its world premiere at the festival in 2001. More info about the festival and the screening can be found at their website.</blockquote>
I'll be in the US at that time. I'll try to be there!
