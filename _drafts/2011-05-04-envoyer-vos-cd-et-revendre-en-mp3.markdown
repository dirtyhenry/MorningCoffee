<blockquote>The original discs and packaging sent in to Murfie are recycled to save them from a landfill at a later date. By sending in the CDs in the first place, however, members are proving that they own a physical copy, making it legal to then create a digital version of the album available for a one-off download by another member.</blockquote>
