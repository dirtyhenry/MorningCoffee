<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Cuban">Mark Cuban</a>, businessman and owner of the Dallas Mavericks NBA Team
<blockquote>1.  End all software patents. Don’t make them shorter, eliminate them.

2. End all process patents. They serve absolutely no purpose. None.

Some of the benefits of eliminating process and software  ?

a. Reduce the court room costs associated with process and software patent litigation. That is taxpayer money saved.

b. Improve the efficiency of the Patent Office.

c. End the ridiculousness of the current Patent Arms Race.

d. Patent costs cost jobs.</blockquote>
+1.
