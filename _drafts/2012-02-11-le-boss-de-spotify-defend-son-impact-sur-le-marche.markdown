Daniel Ek :
<blockquote>I'd also like to address people <a title="The Black Keys refusent Spotify pour El Camino" href="http://morningcoffee.mickaelflochlay.com/1122/the-black-keys-refusent-spotify-pour-el-camino">who think they'll gain sales by not being on Spotify</a>. There's not a shred of data to suggest that. In fact, all the information available points to streaming services helping to drive sales. Album unit sales were up in the U.S. in 2011, the year Spotify launched, for the first time since 2004. More than a dozen albums which debuted at Number One have been available on Spotify at launch.

Spotify users are helping pay a ton of money back to the industry. You're talking 10 million active users, 2.5 million subscribers — most of them paying $120 (£76) a year, which is double the amount of your average iTunes user. At Spotify, we really want you to democratically win as a musician. The royalty cheques we're paying out now — of course we're happy that there's progress being made, but it's still only in its early days, and it will keep growing.</blockquote>
iTunes Match et Google Music viennent concurrencer les offres de musique légales en ligne. Intéressant.
