<blockquote>This, my friends, is how a reunion is done. Play like you never went away, like you never got older, like you're still topping the charts. Play the hits, but not all of them, to leave us wanting more. Play some deep cuts for the true fans. Play no extended wanky jams or new material. Play like you remember the first time, like this is the first time.</blockquote>
Ah, ce concert de Pulp au Primavera 2011.
