> Sidney Lumet, a director who preferred the streets of New York to the back 
> lots of Hollywood and whose stories of conscience — *12 Angry Men*, *Serpico*, *Dog Day Afternoon*,
> *The Verdict*, *Network* — became modern American film classics, died Saturday
> morning at his home in Manhattan. He was 86.
>
> Mr. Lumet’s moral sense remained acute when he ventured into satire with *Network* (1976), 
> perhaps his most acclaimed film.
